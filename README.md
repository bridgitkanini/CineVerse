## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CineVerse.git
   cd CineVerse
   ```

2. Run a local HTTP server (choose one of the following methods):

   ### Using Python (recommended):
   ```bash
   # For Python 3.x
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

   ### Using Node.js (if you have it installed):
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   Then open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

   ### Alternative: Direct file access
   You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser, but some features might be limited due to browser security restrictions with file:// protocol.

3. The application should now be running in your default web browser.

   > **Note:** The application requires an internet connection to fetch movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

   To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.
